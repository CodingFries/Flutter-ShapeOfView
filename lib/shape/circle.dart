/// within the bounding rectangle. The circle's radius is determined by the smaller

/// This shape supports custom border styling through the [BorderShape] mixin,
/// allowing for outlined circles with configurable border width and color.
///
/// Example usage:
/// ```dart
/// // Create a simple circle
/// CircleShape()
///
/// // Create a circle with a colored border
/// CircleShape(
///   borderWidth: 2.0,
///   borderColor: Colors.blue,
/// )
/// ```

  /// The color of the border stroke.
  ///
  /// Only visible when [borderWidth] is greater than 0.
  /// Defaults to white.
